## The Development Process & Challenges

Having begun this project in the 7th grade, I had not the slightest clue how to do anything involving networking, let alone many of the other features I took on in this game, hence why this is not only my biggest project of all time, but it was also most definitly my most complex and challenging, having spent 2 years of on and off work as well as thousands of hours. Luckily, I ran a YouTube channel in which I logged my monthly (for the most part) progress on development and changes, so a lot of this development (not all of it) is well documented, all of these videos will be embedded below as well as a written portion for each video about challenges and changes for that update.

## Hours of Pixel Art

This project also helped me incredibly in developing my own art style and skills for developing 2D art, that being pixel art.

The game originally began as a Surviv.IO clone to a degree, with the artstyle and perspective being heavily inspired by it. My intent of making these YouTube videos was to grow a small community around the game as well as to get feedback from viewers, that which it did very well even from the first video alone. This video was more a first time showcase of the project as well as the initial inspirations, however it does include a small bit of early early alpha footage. It also has timelapses of me developing artwork as well as code.
