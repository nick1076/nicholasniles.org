## Challenges & Goals

My goal with this game was to create my own CSGO initially. Many months before the inception of this project, me and a friend Jack had developed a very buggy and ugly looking multiplayer FPS with very limited features. When begining this game, I had been both watching and playing a lot of CSGO at the time, and it inspired me to attempt to develop my own. I ripped this initial buggy FPS that me and a friend had developed prior, and began fixing it up/building on top of it. The initial version (after fixes but not after visual revamping/content additions) came out and was documented like this:

It still was basically the old version, with the old guns, assets, mechanics, etc., accept it had been dumbed down in terms of features and had the majority of its bugs fixed. For the coming week I spent many hours developing the latest version (which was shown in the video above). There are not any videos between the one you just saw and the top video, so development footage/information is scarce from that time, however, after a week or two I came out with the last version that I would make:

Since this video, I added a lot of features such as a King of the Hill mode, one which I played with a full lobby of friends and had a ton of fun making/testing with friends.
