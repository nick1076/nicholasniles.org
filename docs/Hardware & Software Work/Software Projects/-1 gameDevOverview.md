# Overview

I love making games and have overall poured thousands of hours into developing games for the single purpose of having fun and because I enjoy doing it. I know both Unity as well as C# incredibly well, and am confident I could make anything using the two together.

The other pages on the left are my big and most complex projects that I have worked on, the majority being by myself but a few I worked on with a close friend. They all exemplify my deep knowledge of programming as well as of art, spritework, sound design, and more.
